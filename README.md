DC-SPECT is a cardiac organ specific SPECT system that composed of multiple collimated heads, in this version the total number of heads is 80. This C++ code is parallelized with OpenMP for CPUs. The input data contains a MATLAB script describing the necessary parameters for setting up the reconstruction, a binary file containing projection on the 80 heads with a Derenzo source simulated with Gate V9.0, as well as a binary file containing simulated system matrix provided by collaborators in University of Arizona, using the GPU-accelrated Monte Carlo simulation software UAMC.

/* Getting started */
//Dependencies cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8) OpenMP
//Installing and excutating
cmake CMakeList.txt 
make 
./SPECT SPECT_head_PSF_derenzo.m 

By executing the code, users will obtain binary files containing raw images after each iteration of MLEM, as well as a text file containing events used in the reconstruction.
Details regarding to the parameters setting can be found in the matlab script SPECT_head_PSF_derenzo.m
